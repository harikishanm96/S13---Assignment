## Model

Custom ResNet model for CIFAR10 classification is meticulously designed to tackle image recognition challenges effectively. It features a preprocessing layer, three primary layers, and an FC layer. Employing Convolutional layers, MaxPooling, Batch Normalization, ReLU activations, and Residual Blocks, it adeptly handles feature extraction while mitigating vanishing gradients.

The model's depth and residual connections culminate in a SoftMax function for efficient class probability scoring, ensuring robust classification performance on CIFAR10 images.
